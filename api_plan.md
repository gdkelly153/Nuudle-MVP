# Plan for Node.js Backend API

This document outlines the plan for creating a new Node.js backend service.

## Project Structure

The new Node.js backend will be housed in a new directory named `api` at the root of the project. This will keep the services organized and independent.

        backend[backend (Python)]
        api[api (New Node.js)]
    end
```

## Steps

1.  **Create a new directory for the Node.js backend.** A new directory named `api` will be created at the root of the project.
2.  **Initialize a new Node.js project.** Inside the `api` directory, a new `package.json` file will be initialized.
3.  **Install the requested dependencies.** The following dependencies will be installed in the `api` directory:
    *   `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
    *   `express`
    *   `cors`
    *   `helmet`
    *   `rate-limiter-flexible`
    *   `dotenv`
4.  **Create a basic server file.** A `server.js` file will be created with a minimal Express server setup to confirm everything is working.
5.  **Add a `.gitignore` file.** A `.gitignore` file will be added to the `api` directory to ignore `node_modules`.
