# Session Summary Refinement Plan 5.0 (Final)

This plan provides a comprehensive solution to the border cutoff and modal close button issues, based on a detailed analysis of the existing styles.

## 1. "Moving Forward" Border Cutoff in Light Mode

*   **Goal:** Ensure the bottom border is fully visible.
*   **Analysis:** The root cause is `overflow-y: auto` on the `.modal-content` container, which is clipping the border of its last child.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Remove `overflow-y: auto` from `.modal-content`.
    *   Apply `overflow-y: auto` to `.summary-content` instead. This will ensure that only the summary content is scrollable, while the modal's padding and borders remain fixed and fully visible.

## 2. Modal Close Button (`.modal-close-button`)

*   **Goal:** Ensure the "X" button is layered on top of the session summary card.
*   **Analysis:** The `.summary-content` has a `z-index` of 1, which is causing it to overlap the close button.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Increase the `z-index` of `.modal-close-button` to `10`. This will ensure it is always rendered on top of all other content in the modal.
