# Session Summary Refinement Plan 2.0

This plan addresses the feedback on the session summary card styling for both dark and light modes.

## 1. Dark Mode Refinements

*   **"Moving Forward" Section (`.conclusion-section`):**
    *   **Goal:** Change the background to a light gray with a golden mustard border and ensure proper text contrast.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Set `background-color` to `var(--bg-primary)` (`#333333`), which is a lighter gray in the dark theme's palette.
        *   Add a `2px solid var(--golden-mustard)` border.
        *   Change the text `color` to `var(--text-primary)` (`#e0e0e0`) for optimal readability against the new background.

## 2. Light Mode Refinements

*   **"Moving Forward" Section (`.conclusion-section`):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the bottom border is fully visible and not cut off.
    *   **Analysis:** The issue is likely caused by the section's container not having enough bottom margin or padding to accommodate the border.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Add `margin-bottom: 2rem` to the `.summary-section:last-child` to provide enough space below the conclusion section for the border to be fully rendered.

*   **Timeline Section (`.timeline`):**
    *   **Goal:** Make the section appear less faded by strengthening its border.
    *   **Analysis:** The current border uses a transparent color (`--border-medium`), which causes the faded look.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Change the `border-color` from `var(--border-medium)` to `var(--golden-mustard-border)` (`#a6814e`), which is a solid, darker shade of mustard. This will provide a more defined and less translucent appearance.
