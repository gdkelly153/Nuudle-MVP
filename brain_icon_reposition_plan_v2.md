# Revised Plan: Reposition the Brain Icon

This plan addresses the failure of the initial attempt to reposition the brain icon. The root cause was a conflicting CSS rule in the global stylesheet.

## Deeper Analysis

After examining `frontend/src/app/globals.css`, the following style rule was identified as the cause of the issue:

```css
.brain-icon {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  z-index: 10;
}
```

The `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` property was overriding any inline styles or Tailwind classes, forcing the icon to remain centered at the top-left corner.

## Revised Implementation Plan

1.  **Update Global Stylesheet (`globals.css`):**
    *   In `frontend/src/app/globals.css`, the `.brain-icon` class will be modified.
    *   The `transform` property will be changed from `translate(-50%, -50%)` to `translate(-25%, -25%)`. This will correctly shift the icon down and to the right, creating the desired overlap.

2.  **Clean Up Component (`AIComponents.tsx`):**
    *   To avoid conflicting styles and maintain clean code, the unnecessary positioning classes will be removed from the `Brain` icon in `frontend/src/components/AIComponents.tsx`.
    *   The `className` for the `Brain` icon will be simplified to `"brain-icon w-5 h-5 text-blue-600"`.
    *   The container `div` will be reverted to `className="help-me-nuudle-button-container inline-block"`.

This approach directly addresses the root cause and is expected to correctly position the icon.
