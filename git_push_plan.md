# Git Push Plan to Deploy Backend Fixes

This plan outlines the steps to commit the recent backend fixes to your Git repository and deploy them to your live Render environment.

### **Context**

We have made the following critical changes to the backend:

1.  **Migrated `ai_service.py` to MongoDB:** All database operations in the AI service now use MongoDB instead of the legacy SQLite, resolving the "Failed to generate summary" error.
2.  **Configured Local Environment:** Created a `.env` file with the `MONGODB_URI` to allow the local server to connect to the database.
3.  **Added `.gitignore`:** Ensured that the `.env` file containing sensitive credentials is not committed to the repository.

### **Deployment Steps**

To deploy these changes, you will need to execute the following Git commands in your terminal from the root directory of the project (`/Users/garrettkelly/Desktop/Nuudle/nuudle`).

1.  **Stage the Changes:** This command adds all the modified and new files to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Commit the Changes:** This command saves the staged changes to your local repository with a descriptive message that explains what was fixed.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: Migrate AI service to MongoDB and fix local env"
    ```

3.  **Push to Main Branch:** This command uploads your local commits to the `main` branch of your remote GitHub repository. Render will detect this push and automatically trigger a new deployment.
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

### **Expected Outcome**

After you push the changes, Render will start a new build. You can monitor the deployment progress in your Render dashboard. Once the deployment is complete, the "Failed to generate summary" error should be resolved in your live application.
