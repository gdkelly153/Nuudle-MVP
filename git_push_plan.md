### Plan to Push Code

1.  **Check Git Status:** I'll start by checking the current status of your local repository to see which files have been modified, added, or deleted.
2.  **Stage Changes:** Next, I'll add all the changes to the staging area, preparing them for the commit.
3.  **Create New Branch:** I will then create a new branch named `feature/new-branch`.
4.  **Commit Changes:** I'll commit the staged changes with your provided message: `feat:implemented AI coach feature`.
5.  **Push to Remote:** Finally, I'll push the new branch and its commit to your remote GitHub repository.

Here is a diagram illustrating the workflow:

    A[Check git status] --> B{Any changes?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Add all changes to staging];
    C --> D[Create new branch: feature/new-branch];
    D --> E[Commit changes: "feat:implemented AI coach feature"];
    E --> F[Push 'feature/new-branch' to remote repository];
    B -- No --> G[Inform you there are no changes to commit];
