Hello! I've reviewed your comprehensive feedback and have created a detailed plan to address all the requested changes. This plan covers UI text updates, styling fixes for the buttons and text truncation, and significant enhancements to the AI prompt generation logic to make the assistant more dynamic and helpful.

### 1. UI and Styling Updates

I'll start by making the requested text and style changes to the frontend components.

*   **File:** [`frontend/src/components/AIComponents.tsx`](frontend/src/components/AIComponents.tsx)
    *   **Button Text:** Change `"Help me discover overlooked causes"` to `"Help me identify root causes"` in the `buttonText` object.
    *   **Button Icon:** Remove the `<CheckCircle>` icon from the "This helps" button to address the button sizing issue.
*   **File:** [`frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx`](frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx)
    *   **Instructional Text:** Change `"Select each action that you're worried about taking."` to `"Select each action that you're hesitant about taking, then complete the fear, mitigation, and contingency prompts to build your confidence."`
*   **File:** [`frontend/src/app/globals.css`](frontend/src/app/globals.css)
    *   **Button Sizing:** After removing the icon, I will inspect the CSS for the `.feedback-button` class to ensure both feedback buttons have consistent padding and sizing.
    *   **Text Truncation:** I will investigate the CSS properties related to the AI response card, specifically looking at `max-height`, `overflow`, and any other properties that might cause the text to be cut off. I suspect the issue might be related to how the height of the `AIResponseCard` is calculated, especially with long markdown content.

### 2. AI Prompt Logic Enhancements

Next, I will update the AI prompt generation logic in the backend to align with your vision for a more dynamic and insightful AI assistant.

*   **File:** [`api/services/aiService.js`](api/services/aiService.js)

    I will modify the `prompts` object to incorporate the following changes:

    #### General Prompt Structure Changes

    To make the AI's responses feel more organic and less templated, I'll introduce a more consistent and user-centric flow across all prompts. Hereâ€™s a Mermaid diagram illustrating the new proposed structure for a typical two-part AI response:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Start] --> B{User Input Analysis};
        B --> C[**Section 1: Reflection**];
        C --> C1[Intro: Validate user's input & set context];
        C1 --> C2[Body: Ask targeted questions about user's input];
        C2 --> D[Transition Sentence];
        D --> E[**Section 2: Discovery**];
        E --> E1[Intro: Explain purpose of exploring new ideas];
        E1 --> E2[Body: Ask broader, discovery-oriented questions];
        E2 --> F[End];
    ```

    #### Specific Prompt Updates

    1.  **`perpetuation` ("Help me reflect on my role"):**
        *   I will remove the "Understanding Your Role" section.
        *   The prompt will be rewritten to focus solely on "Discovering Contributing Patterns."
        *   The intro to this section will be updated to incorporate the key ideas from the old intro, focusing on honest self-reflection and uncovering subtle benefits of current behaviors, without the prescriptive language you pointed out.

    2.  **`root_cause` ("Help me identify root causes"):**
        *   I will add a transition sentence after the first section to bridge the user's provided causes with the AI's suggestions for other potential causes.

    3.  **`potential_actions` ("Help me with potential actions"):**
        *   The first section will be revised to prompt the AI to *evaluate* the user's proposed actions for effectiveness and potential pitfalls, rather than just asking questions.
        *   The prompt will also guide the AI to suggest *how* to implement the actions effectively.

    4.  **All Prompts (Second Section Intro):**
        *   For all prompts with a second "discovery" section, I will add a brief introduction to explain the value of considering alternative perspectives, as you suggested.

### 3. Text Truncation Deep Dive

The text truncation issue is a priority. My investigation will cover:

1.  **API Response:** In [`api/services/aiService.js`](api/services/aiService.js), I see the `max_tokens` is set to `512`. While this seems reasonable, the `summarizeUserInput` function might be truncating the input too aggressively. I will examine this.
2.  **React Component Rendering:** In [`frontend/src/components/AIComponents.tsx`](frontend/src/components/AIComponents.tsx), I'll check how the `ReactMarkdown` component renders the response and if any parent containers have style attributes that could limit the height.
3.  **CSS Styling:** In [`frontend/src/app/globals.css`](frontend/src/app/globals.css), I'll look for any `max-height` or `overflow: hidden` properties on the `.ai-response-card` or related elements that could be causing the truncation. The `useLayoutEffect` in `SessionWizard.tsx` that adjusts textarea heights might also be unintentionally affecting the AI response card.

I believe this plan addresses all of your points and will result in a significantly improved user experience.
