# Final Plan to Correct UI Spacing and Width

The goal is to fix the layout inconsistencies for the "My Contributions" section in Step 3 of the session wizard, ensuring it aligns perfectly with the "Contributing Cause" items.

### 1. Analyze Component Structure
A detailed analysis of the JSX and CSS in `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx` will be performed, focusing on the containers for the "Contributing Cause" items versus the "My Contributions" items. The visual evidence confirms that the "My Contributions" section is structurally different, which is the root cause of the layout inconsistencies.

### 2. Proposed Changes
*   **Correct Vertical Spacing**: The `margin-top` for the "My Contributions" section will be adjusted from `2rem` to `1rem`. This will make the vertical spacing consistent with the `marginBottom: '1rem'` style that is already applied to the other actionable items, creating a uniform rhythm.
*   **Standardize Width by Refactoring JSX**: The core issue of the width difference will be resolved by refactoring the JSX for the "My Contributions" section to precisely mirror the structure of the "Contributing Cause" items. This will involve wrapping the "My Contributions" `textarea` and its associated "Possible Action" box in the same nested `divs` (such as `actionable-item-container` and its children) that are used by the other items. This structural mirroring will ensure that they inherit the exact same layout styles, including width and padding, from the existing CSS, guaranteeing a consistent and pixel-perfect look.

This plan addresses the root cause of the problem by correcting the component structure, which will result in a more robust and visually consistent layout.
