### Plan to Implement Session Summary Modal

1.  **Refactor `page.tsx` for Automatic Summary Generation**:
    *   In `frontend/src/app/session/[id]/page.tsx`, modify the `useEffect` hook. Instead of just fetching session data, it will also trigger the `generateSummary` function immediately after the data is successfully fetched.
    *   This will remove the need for the "Generate Summary" button, which will be deleted.

2.  **Remove the Checkmark and Original Summary Section**:
    *   Remove the entire `div` with the class `session-completion-container` from `frontend/src/app/session/[id]/page.tsx`, which contains the checkmark and the initial session overview.

3.  **Implement the Modal Logic**:
    *   Introduce a new state variable, `showSummaryModal`, initialized to `false`.
    *   When the AI summary data is successfully fetched and set, update `showSummaryModal` to `true`.
    *   The summary content, currently in a `div` with the id `summary-content`, will be wrapped in a new modal structure. This modal will only be rendered if `showSummaryModal` is `true`.
    *   A close button will be added to the modal to allow the user to dismiss it, which will set `showSummaryModal` back to `false`.

4.  **Add Modal Styles to `globals.css`**:
    *   Add new CSS rules to `frontend/src/app/globals.css` for the following classes:
        *   `.modal-overlay`: A fixed-position, full-screen overlay with a semi-transparent background.
        *   `.modal-content`: A container for the summary that is centered on the screen, with a white background, padding, and rounded corners. It will also have a max-height and be scrollable for longer summaries.
        *   `.modal-close-button`: A styled close button (an "X") positioned at the top-right corner of the modal.
