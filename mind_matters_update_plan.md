# Plan to Remove the Period from "Mind Matters."

1.  **Locate the Target File:** The text is located in the file `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx`.
2.  **Identify the Specific Line:** The line to be modified is line 761, which currently reads:
    ```tsx
    <h2 className="subheader">Mind Matters.</h2>
    ```
3.  **Propose the Change:** I will modify this line to remove the period, resulting in:
    ```tsx
    <h2 className="subheader">Mind Matters</h2>
    ```
4.  **Execute the Change:** I will use the `apply_diff` tool to make this specific change to the file.
