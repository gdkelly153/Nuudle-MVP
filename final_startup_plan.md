# Final Startup Plan

## 1. The Problem

The backend server is crashing because it cannot find the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable. As you correctly deduced, this is a direct result of the recent migration from SQLite to MongoDB. The new code requires this database key, but the local server process doesn't know where to find the `.env` file that contains it.

## 2. The Solution

To get your local environment fully in sync with the new MongoDB architecture, we need to explicitly tell the application where to load its configuration from. This will ensure the local server can find the `MONGODB_URI`, just like the production server on Render does.

## 3. Execution Steps

I will execute the following steps to resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Modify `main.py` to Specify the `.env` Path (Code Mode)
I will switch to Code Mode and apply a diff to `backend/main.py`. This change will modify the `load_dotenv()` call to explicitly point to the correct file path, ensuring the MongoDB key is always found.

-   **Current Code:** `load_dotenv()`
-   **New Code:** `load_dotenv(dotenv_path="backend/.env")`

### Step 2: Provide Final Instructions
Once the code is fixed, I will provide the final instructions for you to restart the backend server. This change will resolve the startup error and fully align your local environment with the production setup.
