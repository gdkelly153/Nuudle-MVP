# Plan to Update "Begin" Button Functionality

The goal is to ensure the user provides a well-defined problem statement before proceeding to the next steps in the session wizard. This will be achieved by automatically triggering AI assistance if the initial problem statement is too simplistic.

## Definition of a "Simplistic" Problem Statement

A problem statement will be considered "simplistic" if it lacks essential context. We will check for the presence of keywords and phrases that indicate context, such as:

*   **What:** Clarity of definition or meaning.
*   **Where:** The location or situation.
*   **When:** The time or frequency.
*   **So that:** The purpose or desired outcome (e.g., "in order to," "to what end").

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Create a Helper Function:**
    *   A new helper function, `isProblemSimplistic()`, will be created in `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx`.
    *   This function will implement the logic to check for the contextual keywords mentioned above.

2.  **Modify `startSession` Function:**
    *   The `startSession` function in `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx` will be updated to use the `isProblemSimplistic()` helper function.

3.  **Implement Conditional Logic:**
    *   When the user clicks the "Begin" button, `startSession` will be called.
    *   If `isProblemSimplistic()` returns `true`, the application will automatically call `ai.requestAssistance("problem_articulation", painPoint, { painPoint });` to guide the user in elaborating on their problem.
    *   If `isProblemSimplistic()` returns `false`, the application will proceed to step 1 of the wizard as it currently does.
