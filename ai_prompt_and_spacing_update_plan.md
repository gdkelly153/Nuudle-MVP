### **1. Improve Bullet Point Spacing**

To fix the spacing between bullet points in the AI's responses, I'll add a new CSS rule to the `frontend/src/app/globals.css` file. This rule will target the list items within the AI response card and add a bottom margin to create more separation.

### **2. Enhance the "Help Me Identify Assumptions" AI Prompt**

I will update the `identify_assumptions` prompt in the `api/services/aiService.js` file to better guide the user. The new prompt will instruct the AI to:

*   **Evaluate assumptions for accuracy:** Instead of just challenging assumptions, the AI will assess how well they align with the user's stated causes.
*   **Guide validation:** The AI will prompt the user with questions and suggest actions to help them validate or invalidate their assumptions.
*   **Ensure consistency:** I will add the standard introductory and concluding sentences to this prompt to match the others in the user flow.

### **Plan Overview**

Here is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the plan:
