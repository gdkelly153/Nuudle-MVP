### Plan to Update `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx`

Here are the planned modifications for the `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx` file:

1.  **Adjust AI Button Spacing:**
    *   To fix the spacing issue with the "Help me with potential actions" button in Step 3, its container (`div.ai-button-container`) will be moved inside the `div.form-content` to ensure consistent placement with other AI buttons.

    *   **Mermaid Diagram of Structural Change:**
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            subgraph Before
                A["div.form-content"]
                B["div.ai-button-container"]
            end
            subgraph After
                C["div.form-content"] --> D["div.ai-button-container"]
            end
        ```

2.  **Update On-Screen Text:**
    *   The description text in Step 3 will be changed from "For each contributing cause you identified, outline a potential action you can take to begin addressing it." to "Select a contributing cause and outline a potential action you could take to address it.".
    *   The placeholder text in the final step will be updated from "Optional: Elaborate on the exact steps you intend to take here..." to "Optional Nuudling space if you'd like to elaborate.".

3.  **Center Text Box Labels:**
    *   The labels for "Contributing Cause", "Potential Assumption", and "My Contributions" will be centered above their respective text boxes by adding the inline style `style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center' }}` to each `item-label`.
