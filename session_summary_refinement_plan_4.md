# Session Summary Refinement Plan 4.0

This plan addresses the final styling refinements for the timeline text color and the "Moving Forward" section's border visibility in light mode.

## 1. Timeline Section Text Color

*   **Goal:** Darken the text to improve readability and eliminate the faded appearance.
*   **Analysis:** The current text color, `--text-secondary` (`#666666`), is still too light. I will use a darker shade of gray for better contrast.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   In `globals.css`, I will update the `.timeline p` rule to use `--text-primary` (`#333333`), which is the darkest neutral color in the light theme. This will provide a significant improvement in contrast.

## 2. "Moving Forward" Section Border in Light Mode

*   **Goal:** Ensure the bottom border is fully visible, mirroring the behavior in dark mode.
*   **Analysis:** The `z-index` solution was not sufficient. The discrepancy between light and dark modes suggests there is a specific dark mode style that is inadvertently fixing the issue.
*   **Hypothesis:** The issue in light mode might be related to the `box-shadow` on the `.summary-content` container. It's possible that the shadow is interacting with the border in a way that makes it appear cut off.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   To ensure the border is fully visible, I will add a small amount of `padding-bottom` to the `.summary-content` container. This will create a buffer at the bottom, preventing the border of its last child from being clipped. A value of `1px` should be enough to resolve the issue without affecting the layout.
