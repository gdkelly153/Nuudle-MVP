# Plan to Reduce Animation Speed

The goal is to reduce the animation speed by half.

### 1. Identify Target CSS Rules
The animations are defined in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`. The key animations are `radiate-1` through `radiate-5` and `brain-pulse`.

### 2. Modify Animation Durations
- For the `light-particle` elements, the `radiate-*` animations currently have a duration of `5s`. This will be doubled to `10s` to make the animation twice as slow.
- The `.brain-pulsing` class has an animation duration of `1.5s`. This will be doubled to `3s`.

### 3. Implementation
After this plan is saved, I will switch to Code mode to apply these changes to the `frontend/src/app/globals.css` file.
