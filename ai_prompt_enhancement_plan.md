# Final Plan: Truly Concise and Integrated Conclusions

This plan replaces each conclusion entirely with a new, streamlined version that carries the directive you want without any repetition.

| Prompt Stage | Proposed Final Conclusion (Complete Replacement) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `problem_articulation` | A clear problem description is the best starting point for this process. If these questions spark new details, consider updating your description to better frame the situation. |
| `root_cause` | The goal of this analysis is to get to foundational, underlying root causes. If this analysis has helped reveal deeper factors, updating your list of causes will help focus your efforts on what's truly driving the situation. |
| `identify_assumptions` | To build a solid foundation for your thinking, it's crucial to test your assumptions. If this reflection has clarified your perspective, revising your stated assumptions will ensure your approach is grounded in reality. |
| `identify_assumptions_discovery` | Identifying the assumptions that shape your approach is a key step in this process. As potential beliefs are uncovered, adding any that resonate to your list will create a more complete picture of what's influencing your thinking. |
| `potential_actions` | To build an effective plan, it's helpful to think through multiple actions. If these perspectives introduce new possibilities, consider refining your action plan to create the best path forward. |
| `perpetuation` | This reflective exercise is a thought experiment to increase your awareness of your own patterns. It is up to you to decide what feels accurate, and if this reflection reveals any unintentional behaviors, updating your analysis can lead to greater self-awareness and control. |
| `action_planning` | A confident plan is built by thinking through potential fears. If these strategies seem helpful, incorporating them into your action plan can create a more robust path forward. |
