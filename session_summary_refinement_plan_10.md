# Session Summary Refinement Plan 10: The `box-shadow` Border Replacement

## 1. Analysis of Failure

Previous attempts failed because they were based on the incorrect hypothesis that a parent element was clipping the `.conclusion-section`. The user's key insight was that the element's `background` is fully visible, and only the `border` itself is being clipped at the bottom. This points to a browser-specific rendering bug with the `border` property, not an overflow issue.

## 2. New Hypothesis

The browser is failing to correctly render the bottom `border` of the `.conclusion-section` element. This rendering bug is likely triggered by a specific combination of factors:
- The element has a `border-radius`.
- It is the last child inside a scrollable parent container (`.summary-content`).
- The bug is specific to the `border` property's rendering logic.

## 3. Definitive Solution: `box-shadow` Border

The solution is to stop using the `border` property for the visual effect and instead use `box-shadow`, which is rendered differently and is not susceptible to this bug.

To implement this without affecting the page layout, we will:
1.  **Preserve Layout:** Keep the border property but make it transparent. This ensures the element continues to occupy the exact same space in the DOM.
    - `border: 2px solid transparent;`
2.  **Create Visual Border:** Add an `inset box-shadow` that perfectly mimics the original border's appearance.
    - `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2px var(--golden-mustard);`

This combination is robust, maintains layout integrity, and directly circumvents the suspected rendering bug.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Switch to Code Mode.**
2.  **Modify `frontend/src/app/globals.css`:**
    - Locate the `.conclusion-section` rule.
    - Replace `border: 2px solid var(--golden-mustard);` with the two new properties described above.
3.  **Verify:** The user will manually verify that the border now appears correctly in light mode.
