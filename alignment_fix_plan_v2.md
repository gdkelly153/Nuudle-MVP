# Plan to Fix Text Vertical Alignment (Version 2)

This plan corrects the previously failed attempt and proposes a robust solution for the vertical alignment of text within the textareas in Step 3.

## 1. Revert Failed Change

The first step is to remove the incorrect CSS that was previously added.

*   **Action:** Remove the `display: flex;` and `align-items: center;` properties from the `.auto-resizing-textarea` CSS class in `frontend/src/app/SessionWizard.tsx`.

## 2. New Solution: Add Vertical Padding

The root cause of the alignment issue is a lack of vertical padding inside the `textarea` elements. The correct solution is to add this padding directly.

*   **Analysis:** The text appears top-aligned because there is no space between the text itself and the top border of the `textarea`. By adding `padding-top` and `padding-bottom`, we can create this space, which will give the visual effect of vertical centering for single lines and provide better spacing for multiple lines. This solution works with the existing height-adjustment script, not against it.

*   **Action:** Add `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` to the `.auto-resizing-textarea` CSS class. A value like `0.8rem` should provide the correct visual centering.

    ```css
    .auto-resizing-textarea {
      padding-top: 0.8rem;
      padding-bottom: 0.8rem;
      /* Other styles will be preserved */
    }
    ```

This approach is the standard and correct way to handle internal spacing for `textarea` elements and will resolve the alignment issue you pointed out.
