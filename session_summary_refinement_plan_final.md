# Session Summary Refinement Plan: Final

## 1. Goal

Revert the `background` color of the `.conclusion-section` to its original state (`var(--bg-secondary)`) now that the border rendering issue has been definitively solved using the `box-shadow` technique.

## 2. Implementation Plan

1.  **Switch to Code Mode.**
2.  **Modify `frontend/src/app/globals.css`:**
    - Locate the `.conclusion-section` rule.
    - Change the `background` property from `var(--bg-primary)` back to `var(--bg-secondary)`.
3.  **Verify:** The user will confirm that the background color has been reverted while the border remains correctly displayed.
