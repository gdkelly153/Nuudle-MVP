# Session Summary Refinement Plan 3.0 (Final)

This plan addresses the final refinements for the session summary card styling, focusing on the timeline text color and the "Moving Forward" section's border visibility.

## 1. Timeline Section (`.timeline`)

*   **Goal:** Revert the border to its previous state and darken the text to improve readability and reduce the faded appearance.
*   **Analysis:** The timeline content is rendered inside a `<p>` tag within the `.timeline` div.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Border:** In `globals.css`, change the `border` for `.timeline` back to `2px solid var(--border-medium)`.
    *   **Text:** In `globals.css`, add a new rule to target the text within the timeline:
        ```css
        .timeline p {
          color: var(--text-secondary);
        }
        ```
        This will darken the text to `#666666`, providing better contrast.

## 2. "Moving Forward" Section (`.conclusion-section`)

*   **Goal:** Ensure the bottom border is fully visible and not cut off.
*   **Analysis:** The session summary is displayed within a modal (`.modal-overlay`). The border cutoff is likely happening because the `.conclusion-section` is the last element inside the `.summary-content` div, and there's no padding or margin at the bottom of the modal to accommodate the border. The `z-index` approach is the most robust solution.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   In `globals.css`, apply `position: relative` and `z-index: 1` to the `.summary-content` class. This will ensure it sits on top of any other elements within the modal and that its border is not obstructed.
