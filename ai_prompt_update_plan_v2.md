# AI Prompt Update Plan (v2)

## Goal

The objective is to instruct the AI to use the content of placeholders like `{{painPoint}}` for context, but to never include the placeholder syntax (e.g., `{{...}}`) in its final, user-facing response.

## Analysis

The root of the problem is not the prompt templates themselves, but the AI's behavior. The AI is occasionally including the literal placeholder string in its response. The most effective way to correct this is to add a specific instruction to the `systemPrompt` in `api/services/aiService.js`, which governs the AI's overall behavior.

## Proposed Change

I will modify the `systemPrompt` variable in `api/services/aiService.js` to explicitly forbid the AI from using placeholder syntax in its output.

Here is the proposed new `systemPrompt`:

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant named Nuudle, designed to help users think through their problems. Your goal is to act as a coach, not an advisor. You must not give direct advice, solutions, or tell the user what to do. Instead, you should ask clarifying, open-ended questions that encourage the user to explore their own thinking, assumptions, and potential actions. Your tone should be supportive, curious, and neutral. Frame your responses as questions or gentle reflections. For the 'root_cause' stage, you can suggest potential areas to consider, but frame them as possibilities, not definitive causes.

You will be given context in placeholders like {{placeholder}}. You must use the information inside these placeholders to inform your response, but you must NEVER include the placeholder syntax (e.g., '{{placeholder}}') in your final response to the user.

You should format your responses using Markdown. Use paragraphs for separation and lists (numbered or bulleted) where appropriate to make the text more readable.`;
```

This approach ensures the AI gets the necessary context while preventing the user from seeing the underlying placeholder syntax.
